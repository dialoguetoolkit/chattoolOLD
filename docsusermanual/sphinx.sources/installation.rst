Downloading and installing the toolkit
========================================

The toolkit is currently hosted on github at https://github.com/dialoguetoolkit/chattool

The toolkit is stored as a netbeans project (http://netbeans.org). You can of course use your own IDE, or run it from the command-line. However, it is easiest to run and script using netbeans. If you use netbeans, it should work "out-of-the-box" - there should be no need to play around with linking libraries and directory paths.
