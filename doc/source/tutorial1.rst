From a programming perspective, there are, broadly speaking, seven different types of experiment: 

* Interventions that insert text into participants' turns.
* Interventions that remove text from particiapnts'  turns.
* Interventions that modify text in participants' turns.
* Interventions that modify the timing of participants' turns 
* Interventions that assign participants to different participants (i.e. to different linguistic subcommunities)
* Interventions that "spoof" the identity of a participants - making it appear that Participant A typed Participant B's turn.
* Interventions that modify features of the chat interface (e.g. size, colour, etc.) 

Of course - some experiments might involve multiple types of intervention - e.g. manipulating the timing and apparent identity of participants' turns.
